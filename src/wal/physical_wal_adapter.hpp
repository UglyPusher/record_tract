/**
 * @file physical_wal_adapter.hpp
 * @brief Compile-time selection point for the physical WAL implementation.
 *
 * The selected header defines fexma::wal::detail::PhysicalWalAdapter,
 * PhysicalWalReaderAdapter, and PhysicalWalRecoveryAdapter with the direct
 * write/read/truncate contracts used by the runtime WAL and cold path.
 * Selecting a filesystem, direct-NVMe, or another hardware-specific
 * implementation means changing this include and the corresponding build
 * source, then rebuilding. No runtime dispatch, virtual interface, or CRTP is
 * used.
