# Building And Testing

From the repository root:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The WAL target enables the repository's maximum standard warning set: `/W4`
and `/permissive-` on MSVC, or `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` elsewhere.

The contract executables cover configuration, warmed aligned storage, hot-path
allocations, FIFO and wrap-around, durability batching, physical file format,
CRC and padding, injected append/sync failures, concurrent producer,
durability-writer, and consumer roles, and ordinary slider ordering, frontier,
failure, and upstream behavior. The bare-pipeline executable covers
linear reclamation, stopped-stage backpressure, retained-slot stability,
wraparound, and concurrent producer/slider operation. The reader and recovery
executables cover validated scanning, corruption classification, conservative
incomplete-tail truncation, physical synchronization, and refusal without
mutation. The persistence-slider executable covers bounded batches, sync-before
publication, downstream gating, append/sync failure, durable-prefix draining,
and reader/scanner compatibility.
