# WAL

A bounded `RecordTape` with separately composable physical WAL persistence.

`RecordTape` owns only:

```text
tail <= retained positions < head
```

`RecordTape` provides producer publication, absolute-position immutable views,
bounded reclamation, and position exhaustion handling. `PersistenceModule`
owns live append/sync and its failure state. Their lifecycles are independent.
`PersistenceSlider` binds that module to `head`, reads its current position from
the durable `Frontier`, and publishes that authoritative progress only after a
complete batch sync.

`Slider` provides synchronous stage mechanics over `RecordTape`. It reads
either `RecordTape::head()` or an upstream `Frontier`, invokes one statically
bound module in position order, and publishes its own `Frontier` after each
successful record. It owns no worker, polling loop, wait strategy, or domain
semantics.
`NoOpModule` is the trivial successful stage used to prove the first bare
composition: `head -> NoOpSlider -> tail`.

RecordTape public value types live in `record_tape_types.hpp`; physical WAL
format and lifecycle types live in `types.hpp`. RecordTape headers do not
include the physical WAL types. The current RecordTape `default_alignment` and
physical `wal_default_alignment` are both 64 but are independent defaults, not
a shared contract.

One static `RecordTape`/persistence-slider composition can be wired as:

```text
producer -> [durable, head) -> physical sync -> [tail, durable) -> consumer
```

That composition has three absolute frontiers:

```text
tail <= durable <= head
head - tail <= capacity
```

`RecordTape::try_publish()` writes one block and publishes `head`.
`PersistenceSlider::process_available()` appends a bounded batch, performs one
OS-level physical sync, and then publishes `durable`. The composition reclaims
positions through its final mandatory downstream frontier.

`open()` creates only a new WAL file and never truncates an existing path. The
physical file uses canonical little-endian headers and aligned record offsets.
Its immutable identity binds one stream kind and ID to one epoch, manifest, and
payload schema; runtime ring capacity is intentionally not persisted.

`WalReader` opens an existing file only when its complete persisted identity
matches the caller's expected configuration. It exposes a record only after
validating physical headers, sequence, CRCs, payload, and zero padding.
`scan_wal()` reports the longest trusted prefix without modifying the file.

`recover_incomplete_tail()` is the separate, conservative mutation boundary.
With exclusive ownership of a quiescent file, it may truncate only a physically
incomplete trailing record to the scanner-proven trusted offset, synchronize
that truncation, and validate the complete file again. Complete invalid records,
middle corruption, sequence errors, and identity mismatches are refused without
mutation.

After crash, the maximal contiguous CRC-valid prefix is the authoritative WAL:
every complete record in it participates in replay and rebuild regardless of
client acknowledgement. Batches are live append-and-sync units only. The file
contains no batch commit records or commit markers.
